Send Email from WordPress Via MailGun's transactional email service.

### Description

Sometime you don't want to send email from your own webserver.  Some hosts don't allow it. It takes alot of resources and isn't alwats relaible.

In cases like its usually a great idea to get someone else to send it. 

MailGun is a great transational email service that currebtly sends 10,000 free emails on your behalf a month.

This plugin will integrate MailGun with WordPress so it takes over sending all of the mail in WordPress.

Any mail sent via `wp_mail()` will be delivered via MailGun

If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.
